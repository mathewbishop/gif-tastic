Click on a button to display gifs related to that topic, in this case, dogs. Add a new dog by typing the breed name into the form and clicking submit.

This app is utilizing data from the Giphy API. When a dog button is clicked, a query for the word displayed on the button is sent to the Giphy API, and the gif data is returned and displayed on the page. Still images appear first, click on an image to begin the gif animation.
